**Improvement Suggestions for Hyperlane Explorer**

After comparing the Hyperlane Explorer with LayerZero Scan, I have identified several areas for improvement:

1. **Advanced Transaction Filters**: Implement advanced filters that allow users to search for transactions by method, address, and value.
2. **Detailed Transaction View**: Add more columns for gas fees, status, and value to provide a more complete transaction overview.
3. **Cross-Chain Message View**: Create a dedicated tab for viewing cross-chain messages, enhancing the user experience for those working across multiple chains.
4. **Graphs and Metrics**: Introduce visual metrics such as TPS (transactions per second), gas usage, and network performance to better track blockchain health.
5. **Support for More Networks**: Expand support to additional blockchain networks to widen the user base and increase functionality.

These improvements would significantly enhance the usability and functionality of the Hyperlane Explorer.
